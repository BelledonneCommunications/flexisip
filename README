To configure Flexisip, copy and modify file flexisip.conf.sample to flexisip.conf in directory <prefix>/etc/flexisip


ODBC
--------------------
Enable pooling in odbc.ini and use a thread safe driver.
Use ODBCINI and ODBCSYSINI environement variable to override ini files location.
The connection string defined in authentication section of flexisip.conf may use
either a DSN or a DSN-less connection string.

Example odbc.ini file:
[myodbc3]
Driver       = /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/odbc/libmyodbc.so
Description  = MySQL ODBC 3.51 Driver DSN
Server       = localhost
Port         =
User         = user
Password     = password
Database     = flexisip
Option       = 4
Socket       =



Developer notes:
---------------------

With sofia-sip, you have the choice between msg_dup and msg_copy,
sip_from_dup and sip_from_copy etc...
The difference isn't well documented in sofia-sip documentation.
However it is important to understand that
*_copy() just makes a copy of the structure, not the strings pointed by it
*_dup() makes a copy of structure plus all included strings inside.

*_copy() versions can be thus dangerous. Use *_dup() in doubt.
