Flexisip is a complete, modular and scalable SIP server suite written in C++11, comprising proxy, presence and group chat functions.
It also includes a push gateway, to deliver SIP incoming calls or text messages on mobile device platforms where push notifications are required to receive information when the app is not active in the foreground.

Flexisip instances can be deployed on server machines to run a SIP VoIP service. 
The free linphone.org SIP service has run on Flexisip since 2011, and enables Linphone users to create SIP addresses in order to connect with each other.

It can also be embedded and run perfectly on small hardware systems.

# Compilation

Flexisip uses cmake as build system, extended by a prepare.py script written in Python.

## GNU/Linux developer build

You can issue ./prepare.py -lf to see all possible build options.
Then, use the following to proceed with compilation:
	./prepare.py <build options>
	make

Alternatively, should all the dependencies listed above be installed on the system, Flexisip's CMake scripts
can be used directly. For example:

	cmake . -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/belledonne-communications -DSYSCONF_INSTALL_DIR=/etc
	make

## rpm and deb packages

The `flexisip-rpm` prepare.py target can be used to generate RPM packages for Flexisip and its dependencies.
_Alien_ program is used internaly to convert RPMs into Debian packages when this build is run on a Debian or Debian-like GNU/Linux distribution.
The following dependency packages are required (as rpm package name): 
 mbedtls-devel sqlite-devel postgresql-devel rpm-build bison speex-devel

	./prepare.py flexisip-rpm -DENABLE_REDIS=ON -DENABLE_BC_HIREDIS=ON
	make

## Docker

A docker image can be build from sources with command:

	docker build -t flexisip --build-arg=njobs=<njobs> -f docker/flex-from-src .

## Macos X (outdated)

The CMake scripts of Flexisip can be used to develop with Flexisip in Xcode.
You need to run:
- `./prepare.py -G Xcode flexisip \
	-DENABLE_REDIS=NO \
	-DEP_sofiasip_CONFIGURE_OPTIONS=PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/opt/local/lib/pkgconfig/ `
- `xcodebuild -project WORK/flexisip/cmake/Project.xcodeproj/ `
- `open WORK/flexisip/Build/flexisip/flexisip.xcodeproj`

The soci dependency is not easy to install on MacOS. If you need it, you can use these tips, based on "brew" system:

You need to install and unlink mysql :
brew install mysql
brew unlink mysql
Then install mysql-connector-c
brew install mysql-connector-c
And finally install soci with mysql
brew install soci --with-mysql

You can now use `-DENABLE_SOCI=ON` in your prepare options.

# Configuration

Flexisip needs a configuration file to run correctly.
Use `./flexisip --dump-all-default > flexisip.conf` to make a documented
default configuration file.

# Developer notes

With sofia-sip, you have the choice between `msg_dup()` and `msg_copy()`,
`sip_from_dup()` and `sip_from_copy()`, _etc_.
The difference isn't well documented in sofia-sip documentation but it is
important to understand that:
- `*_dup()` makes a copy of the structure plus all included strings inside.
- `*_copy()` just makes a copy of the structure, not the strings pointed by it. **These functions are
dangerous**; use `*_dup()` versions in doubt.
